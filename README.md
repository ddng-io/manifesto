# A new way to do politics

Created: Aug 23, 2020 11:25 AM

## Motivation

In the age of social media, anyone can receive feedback on the most mundane of
questions. _Which phone cover do y'all prefer_ or _which car should I get_ are promptly
answered by friends and followers. In a way, social media likes offer instant feedback
to billions of people. Yet, the most important decisions in our society are
made through numerous layers and filters. Our so called "representative democracies".

we select politicians, with X year feedback cycle

Somehow, the system of selecting a universal representative for a fixed-term became
completely self-evident. Every few years, we get to pick one of a few chosen people who
we barely know to speak in our stead on topics ranging from day-care to fighter yets.

Broken promises or false claims can only be reacted to once the next voting cycle draws
close. Equally, long-term benefits are regularly dismissed over short-term popularity. 


Looking at recent events, another theme becomes relevant: The divide between those that take
actions and those that need to live with the consequences. _Fridays for Future_
demonstrations are a desperate cry by the youth to express their fears that the future
is going to be worse than the present, a sentiment that has not been for a long time.
Why does it matter? Because those that will be most affected are those that are least
represented. Children cannot vote. Their votes aren't weighed less because of their lack
of wisdom, they are simply not counted at all. Utterly dismissed. And so they sit in the
streets out of despair, hoping to be listened to by anyone out there.

Now, in the age of online fitness, language, cooking and music classes, online medical,
legal and psychological consultations, it is time we rethink participatory democracy. It
is time we rethink who gets to vote on what, when, how often and in what matter...

### What if ...

- ... a system could be designed that permits anyone to vote on all things that matter
  without a need to replace the current democratic system?
- ... instead of entrusting a stranger with all the important decisions of society for
  at least 4 years, people may choose anyone as their personal representative for
  customizable topics as long or short as they like
- ... instead of giving all decision powers to one person, they are instead split based
  on competencies?
- ... you could hand off your democratic voice on medical topics to your trusted doctor,
  taking all decisions on digital agenda yourself and letting your father in law
  represent you on matters of tax systems?
- ... the system took long-term impact into consideration and weighted the voices of
  those who have to suffer the consequences of a decision stronger than those who don't
  have to suffer the consequences?
- ... opinions of the youth weren't completely dismissed but instead gradually included
  in the decision process, through weighed votes, allowing engaged adolescent to
  contribute to democratic processes while slowly growing mature
- ... decisions were clearly structured and recorded in a publicly available and
  debatable system online by anyone, politician or citizen, putting a bar in front of
  false claims and overblown hypothetical future effects
- ... legal proposals followed the concepts of open source projects, enabling clear
  tracability of decisions about specifics and early feedback to avoid loop-holes and
  reduce the impact of lobbying efforts
- ... the role of the politician as known today became largely obsolete as voters become
  self-representing and representative democracy becomes distributed and decentralised

In the following document a number of ideas will be introduced that outline a modern way
to reinvent political participation for anyone on a massive scale so that we do politics
the way that a 21st century deserves. A truly democratic system that takes everyone's
voice into consideration and that values transparency truly, exposing all processes and
decisions to everyone.

Inspired by successes from Open Source Software developments, Behavioral Psychology and
taking many of our inherent cognitive biases into consideration, we should bring modern
democracy to most national democracies without any need to replace them, using the
vessel of representative democracy as a mechanism to introduce this new way of
participating.

## Democracy invented after the inception of the internet

As a core principal of this idea, the question is not _how to change democracy to make
it better_ but instead to ask the question _how would democracy look like if it was
invented today?_ Only then will we truly rid ourselves of ankers and old concepts and
define a concept that scales like many of our modern entertainment and social media
platforms. The proposal therefore contains a set of premises which can be considered
already valid for some first world countries and easily achievable by most others. The
two premises are:

- Anyone has access to the internet for at least some period of time of their daily lives
    - those who don't can be enabled to have access for non-substantial sums
- The general population is able to interact with digital devices
  - Those who do not have the technical ability to do so can be aided by others to cast their votes
    or choose a representative, similar to the current system 

## A nested direct democratic system

Consider a typical party poster shortly before an election. The concrete party does not matter but
the pattern is often the same:

- Something that should be done
- A person that is supposed to be able to bring that change
- A logo and branding by the party of choice

En: The future needs new ideas. And someone that enacts them.

Sometimes these slogans are clever, sometimes ankered to local topics. Sometimes they
are very primitive. *Mr X for president* or *Mrs Y for office*. 

Only few parties deviate from this pattern. A _nested direct democratic party_ could instead offer a
poster that simply reads

> Don't vote for anybody. Vote yourself

The idea: A party that allows all those that voted for her to also vote on any matter that the party
votes on in its official position. Simply put, before each parliamentary vote, the party would offer
a poll and ask everyone what they should vote for. Then, the party votes in accordance
with the poll results.  If 40% vote "YES" and 60% "NO", the party does so as well in the
parliament.

This concept has a number of advantages:

- it removes the untrustworthy politician stereotype. In fact, the party will have no politicians.
  It only serves as a proxy to carry the people's vote into the parliament.
- It appeals to anyone who wants to participate more directly in democratic processes
- The party would never break their word. In fact, the party has no program in the classic sense.
- The party is attractive for any voter base of all other parties. Since the party only represents
  the poll (or internal vote), greens, liberals, conservatives and progressives can all be
  represented by the party

An obvious problem arises: What if I don't want to decide everything myself? What if too few people
participate in niche topics and the vote is swayed by small numbers? This is where vote distribution
comes into play.

## Vote distribution

... is the concept of choosing a representative for some or all of the decisions of your democratic
power. As eluded to earlier, some may choose to select either a public figure or a relative or
trusted friend to represent them in matters of political decisions in which they don't feel
comfortable choosing themselves. This is in fact what we do today. We just don't have a choice. We have to
choose others to choose for us or we don't participate at all.

Vote distribution would allow you to select _topics_ or _areas of policy_ where a representative may
be endowed with your vote to choose in your stead. This can be revoked instantly and can be as broad
or specific as each voter would like. As such, anyone can participate in the topics for which they
feel politically engaged and defer all else to people they trust to make good choices in their
stead. As such, no vote should ever suffer from too few participants that skew or take over the vote
through some scheme.

## Verifying identity without central control

- peer to peer based validation

1. new user requests authentication
2. N number of existing authenticated (trustworthy?) users are offered some form of reward to
   authenticate the new user
3. new user needs to physically meet those N users and prove the identity based on an official
   document

## Enabling digital, yet anonymous voting

We need a system that allows both that people can vote with their phone, yet it must be anonymous to
keep up with current democratic processes. To trust that the vote is not forged, some concept of
signed certificate is required (similar to SSL certs), anonymity however is another requirement
which is somewhat orthogonal to this (I don't know from who this is but I know this person is real
and trusted ?!)

### Idea

- Central system distributes "YES" and "NO" vote to each individual, signed with central key,
  containing unique ID for vote
  - avoid forgery
  - avoid double counting
  - missing anonymity
- Casting a vote means taking the above vote and signing it with personal key
  - avoid double counting
  - avoid forgery
  - lacking anonymity
  - claims vote by individual
- Instead of sending the vote to central agency, it's sent encrypted to a "pool" of "anonymizers".
  These throw ~ 1000 votes in a bucket, strip personal IDs and send forward to central agency.
  - These anonymizers are also all voters, meaning it's anyones phone
  - They are chosen at random but every member in the pool gets the same 1000 votes
  - All nodes in pool must have same metrics of votes for the block to be valid
- central agency receives the count YES/NO of group from each member in pool. If all agree, votes
  are valid
  - ensures anonymity
  - utilizes crowd to create trust → majority of anonymizers will be honest

## A few thoughts on technology

- blockchain
  - can be used as decentral and global source of truth
  - enables blocking voter fraud and ability to validate independently
- open source
  - make system trustworthy
  - well tested
  - helps discover vulnerabilities
  - crowd sourced development
- serverless architecture with infra as code
  - scalability to millions
  - portability, reproducability for other countries / regions / organizations
- public/private cryptography
  - individuals own a private key with which to sign their actions
  - enables E2E encryption in parts where needed (e.g. distributing votes to each individual)
- certificate based
  - enables central signing
  - avoids forging of votes
